## So what does it do?

This tiny python based script allows you to download map tiles from Google, Bing, Open Street Maps, ESRI, NASA, and other providers. This script comes with an easy to use web based map UI for selecting the area and previewing tiles.

**Just run the script via command line**

```sh
python server.py
```

Then open up your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8080`. The output map tiles will be in the `output\{timestamp}\` directory by default.
